# HydroNet: Network-Based Early Warning System

## Project Description
Network-based early warning system for hydrological collapse prediction using 12-parameter network analysis and transfer entropy.

## Key Features
- **12-parameter network analysis** across climatic, hydrological, infrastructural, and socioeconomic domains
- **Transfer entropy** for directional information flow quantification
- **System Vulnerability Index (SVI)** for collapse prediction
- **Real-time network topology monitoring**
- **Early warning** with 8.4-month median lead time

## Research Paper
Complete 13,700-word research paper included in repository.

## Technologies
- Python (NetworkX, JIDT, pandas)
- Transfer entropy algorithms
- Graph theory metrics
- Web interfaces (HTML/JavaScript)
